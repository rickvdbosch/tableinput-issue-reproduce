# `TableInput` issue reproduction repo

The only reason for this repo to exist is to reproduce the TableInput issue.  

## Context

There's an Azure Storage account pblcstrg001 that has a table AwesomeEntities that holds 6 entities:

|PartitionKey|RowKey|WhatMakesThisSpecial|
|-|-|-|
|here-be|001|dragons|
|here-be|002|monsters|
|here-be|003|TableInput issues...|
|you-shall|001|pass|
|you-shall|002|steal|
|you-shall|003|covet|

We want to build an Azure Function that gets a specific `AwesomeEntity` from that table using `TableInput`.

## The Functions

This repo holds an Azure Functions project with 3 Functions:

1. `GetAwesomeEntityArray`  
This Function shows that a `TableInput` binding with a PartitionKey and a RowKey returns an IEnumerable of `AwesomeEntity` instances holding all the entities in the specified partition. One would expect one `AwesomeEntity`, but trying this results in an error as can be seen when looking at the second Azure Function.

2. `GetAwesomeEntityFails`  
This Function shows that a `TableInput` binding with a PartitionKey and a RowKey errors out when trying to bind it to the `AwesomeEntity` custom entity type.

3. `GetTableEntityWorks`
This Function shows that a `TableInput` binding with a PartitionKey and a RowKey works when binding it to a `TableEntity`.

## Security

Yes, this repo contains a secret. No, this normally is _not_ recommended. But to ensure the reproduction works completely, I choose to do so either way. The Storage Account the connection string points to is being monitored, and exists in its own shielded environment ðŸ˜Ž
