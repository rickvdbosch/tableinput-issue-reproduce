# `TableInput' issue reproduction repo

The only reason for this repo to exist is to reproduce the TableInput issue.  
Yes, this repo contains a secret. No, this normally is _not_ recommended. But to ensure the reproduction works completely, I choose to do so either way. The Storage Account the connection string points to is being monitored, and exists in its own shielded environment ðŸ˜Ž
